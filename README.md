# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to assist Pewlett-Hackard in understanding the scope of the pending "silver-tsunami", or sudden retirement of a large swath of employees- over 90 thousand of them!

Results: 
- There are 1941 eligible mentors, but 90,399 pending vacancies in the silver tsunami! There will be a big shortage unless each mentor can take on approximately 40 new recruits. Highly unlikely!
- That retirement eligibility will affect a significant number of employees in a relatively short amount of time: 90k employees in an age span of about three years. 
- That retirement eligibility shows significant variation across 7 types of employment at Pewlett-Hackard
-Image reflects the breakdown of pending vacancies by position type. I had difficulty with join and table creation for this data.

Summary: two additional queries-
For all employees 
AVG(salary)
FROM salaries = $52970.732

Analysis-
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Definitely not. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? approx 88k additional roles will need to be filled unless some positions have become obsolete due to technological advancement and innovations. This will be a strategic challenge under the best of circumstances!

There are 7 key positions requiring filling as this group of employees begins to retire: title Engineer, Senior Engineer, Manager, Assistant Engineer, Staff, Senior Staff
Technique Leader. The image above clarifies the pending vacancies for this group.
